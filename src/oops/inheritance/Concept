Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors
of a parent object.
The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon
existing classes.
When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.
Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

WHY USE INHERITANCE IN JAVA
    For Method Overriding(so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
    For Code Re-usability
