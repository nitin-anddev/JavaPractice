Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data(variables) and the code that acts upon them(methods)
are integrated as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them,
and only the methods of the class can access them.

NEED
    Encapsulation improvises the procedure of coding to a whole new level.
    We need encapsulation in Java for various reasons. They are stated below
        1. Better Control
        2. Getter and Setter
        3. Security
        4. Flexibility

Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class\

ADVANTAGES
    By providing only setter or getter method, you can make class read-only or write-only.
    Encapsulation provides you control over the data. Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be
    greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside setter method. You can write the logic not to store
    negative numbers in the setter methods.

    It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the
    data through the private data members.

    The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.
